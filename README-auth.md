# Authentication Implementation for Audio Analyzer Application

## What Has Been Done

1. **Convex Database Schema Update**

   - Added the `userId` field to the `audioAnalysis` table
   - Created a `by_user` index for filtering analyses by user

2. **Authentication Helper Functions Creation**

   - The `convex/users.ts` file contains helper functions to check user authentication status
   - `getUserId()` - retrieves the logged-in user ID
   - `isUserAuthenticated()` - checks if the user is logged in

3. **Convex Audio Functions Update**

   - All Convex functions have been modified to check authentication status
   - Data is filtered so that users only have access to their own analyses
   - Saving analyses is allowed only for logged-in users

4. **User Interface Components for Authorization**

   - `AuthStatus` - component informing about the lack of login
   - `LoginButton` - login button (currently only with a message)

5. **Changes in the ResultsContent Component**
   - Added authentication status check before saving to the database
   - Added information for the user that without logging in, data will not be saved

## How the Authorization System Works

1. All Convex database queries are secured by authentication status checks
2. During data save or read attempts, authentication status is checked first
3. Unauthenticated users:
   - Can use the application and generate analyses
   - Cannot save analyses in the database
   - Will not have access to analyses after leaving the page
4. Authenticated users (after login implementation):
   - Will be able to save analyses
   - Will have access to their previous analyses
   - Will have an individual account with analysis history

## What Needs to Be Added to Complete Implementation

To complete the authorization implementation, the following steps are required:

1. **Add an Authentication Provider**

   - Integrate an external authentication service (e.g., Clerk, Auth0, NextAuth)
   - Implement login and logout functions
   - Configure the authentication provider with Convex

2. **Update the ConvexClientProvider Component**

   - Add authentication handling to ClientProvider
   - Integrate authentication token with Convex queries

3. **Add Account Management Components**
   - User profile
   - Analysis history
   - Account settings

## Implementation Tips

1. Consider using Clerk (https://clerk.com/) as a simple authentication solution
2. Review the Convex documentation on authorization: https://docs.convex.dev/auth
3. Remember to add the appropriate environment variables for the authentication service
